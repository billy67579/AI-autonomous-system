Primary contents of the folder code: This folder make up of python programs 

        1 config.yaml: it is configuration file of custom dataset used.

        2 detect_lane.py: it is the node used for detection of lane using YOLO.

        3 images: it contains images which are trained for model.

        4 labels: annotations of the same images which are used for model.

        5 requirements.txt: libraries required to be installed for using YOLO.

        6 runs: contains pre-trained models.

        7 train.py: node to train the images with annotation and make a model.

        8 yolov8n-seg.pt: used in train.py as reference for training segmentation model.

        9.yolov8n.yaml: used in train.py as reference for training classification model.

        10.masks_to_polygons.py: used to convert segmentation masks to labels.

        11.predict.py: used to predict the trained model on real-time video of the lane.

        12.yolo_segfulltrack56.py: used to run the trained segmentation model on realtime video of the smart city with 56frames.

        13.yolo_segfulltrack25: used to run the trained segmentation model on realtime video of the smart city with 25frames.

        14.yolo-segp.py: used to run inference on the frame of the lane.
         
        15.accuracy.py:  use to calculate the accuracy of the segmentation model
